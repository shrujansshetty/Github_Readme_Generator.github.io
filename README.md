How to change GitHub ReadMe?<br>
If you already have your personal repository (personal repository name is the same as your GitHub username) then you can copy-paste the code generated from GPRM into your ReadMe file. If you don't have your personal repository then follow this:<br>
Step 1 : Go to https://github.com/new and enter the same name as your GitHub username into the Repository name field.<br>
Step 2 : Leave the repo as a Public repo (by default).<br>
Step 3 : Also, make sure to initialize it with a README to get started.<br>
Step 4 : Paste the code generated from this website inside your ReadMe file.<br>
Step 5 : Commit the changes to add a ReadMe to your GitHub Account.<br><br>
Thank You 🙏
